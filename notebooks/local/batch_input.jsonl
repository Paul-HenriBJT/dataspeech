These keywords include:\n1. The gender (male, female)\n2. The level of reverberation (very distant-sounding, distant-sounding, slightly distant-sounding, slightly close-sounding, very close-sounding)\n3. The amount of noise in the sample (extremely noisy, very noisy, noisy, slightly noisy, almost no noise, very clear)\n4. The tone of the speaker's voice (very monotone, monotone, slightly expressive and animated, expressive and animated, very expressive and animated)\n5. The pace of the speaker's delivery (very slowly, slowly, slightly slowly, moderate speed, slightly fast, fast, very fast)\n6. The pitch of the speaker's voice (very low-pitch, low-pitch, slightly low-pitch, moderate pitch, slightly high-pitch, high-pitch, very high-pitch)\n\nYour task is to create a text description using these keywords that accurately describes the speech sample.\nIf the amount of noise is 'very noisy' and the level of reverberation is 'very distant-sounding', you must include terms such as 'very poor recording' or `very bad recording` in the description. \nLikewise, if the amount of noise is 'very clear' and the level of reverberation is 'very close-sounding', you must include terms like 'very good recording' or `excellent recording` in the description. \nYou can randomly omit the following terms, as they are default terms: 'moderate speed' and 'moderate pitch'.\nDo not add extra details beyond what has been provided above. You can change the order of keywords, and replace synonymous terms.\n\nEnsure that the generated description is grammatically correct, easy to understand, and concise. Only return one and only one description.\n\nFor the keywords: '[gender]', '[reverberation]', '[sdr_noise]', '[speech_monotony]', '[speaking_rate]', '[pitch]', the corresponding description is:\n"}], "max_tokens": 1000}}
